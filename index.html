<p class="Group, TabTwo" style="color:white">When taking this class, my understanding of video games or games in general has widened my views on what makes a good game and the many different aspects of them. The most interesting subject to learn was the Mechanics, Dynamics and Aesthetics of video games. The many different relations that can occur between these three concepts has made my look at video games quite differently and have a much better insight on the games. The material for the class seemed very straightforward and smooth transitions to different topics. With the reading materials and the many examples provided, I was able to create my own game that I am quite proud of, I have only made 1 other game before and that was mainly web-based. For this one I was actually able to work on a gaming engine and make a very classic game. I was also able to review many of my classmates' games and it was so intriguing to see their perspective in video games and create them. Along with the many different art styles that they provided for the game and their aesthetic. Overall, this class has made me more intrigued with video games and has helped me provide insight for my career.
